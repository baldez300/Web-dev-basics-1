## Challenges Faced

***Week 2 brought additional challenges as we continued to shape our project. We faced some challenges in defining the project's scope and requirements. Balancing our coursework with the project also remained a significant challenge.***

## What Went Well and Lessons Learned

***During Week 2, our group effectively managed to finalize the project idea and began working on the project prototype in Figma. This was a significant achievement as it gave us a clear direction for our project. We also made progress in learning the technologies required for the project, including Express.js, Node.js, and React. The scrum principles we learned were beneficial for managing our project. We practiced defining our user stories using INVEST and DEEP principles. This helped us understand the importance of well-defined and manageable user stories.***

- #### Key Learning

***I gained a more profound understanding of agile project management principles and how they influence the project's scope and planning. I also learned about the Scrum methodology and its principles, which we began applying to our project.***

- #### Online Resources

***The online resources you provided continued to be highly beneficial, particularly the Scrimba tutorials, articles, videos, and documentation. These resources aided in enhancing my understanding of project management and the MERN stack. I also started diving deeper into React with [React Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk).***

## Coping Strategies:

- #### Academic Progress:

***To address our challenges, we maintained effective communication within the group. We made an effort to understand our project objectives better. I continued to seek help from online resources to enhance my technical knowledge.***

- #### Soft Skills Development

***Communication and collaboration, were crucial in overcoming challenges. I found that open and honest communication within the team was vital for understanding our project goals.***

## Project Management:

***During Week 2, we applied agile project management principles effectively. Our project planning was more structured, and we practiced defining clear and manageable user stories. We started using Figma for prototyping.***

## Final Thoughts:

***Week 2 has shown progress in both the Web development and Web Project courses. Our project discussions advanced, and I have a better understanding of effective collaboration and project management. As we delve deeper into technology stacks, I feel more prepared to apply these concepts to our project. I'm excited to continue our project work...***

## Next Steps:

***In Week 3, I look forward to applying the technologies we've learned to our project. This includes setting up the project environment, developing the initial version of our application, and testing it. I plan to continue my learning journey, focusing on React and the MERN stack. Our group will also refine our project user stories and define the project backlog more comprehensively. We'll aim for more efficient project management.***

**Week 3:** 06/11/23 - 12/11/23
