# Reflection Journal for Week 5
**Student Name:** Mamadou Balde

**Week 5:** 20/11/23 - 26/11/23

## Peer Assessment

Week 5 expanded our understanding of Fetch API, Forms, useEffect(), and rendering and committing in the FrontEnd. The BackEnd focused on password security, JWT, encryption and Token. Here's how each member of my group performed during this week:

| Group Member's Name | Rate on a Scale of 1-5 | Justify My Answer |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Self (Balde)        | 4/5                     | I actively engaged in understanding Fetch API, Forms, and BackEnd security concepts. My contributions were consistent in group discussions and activities. |
| Sami                | 4/5                     | Sami continued to be an active team member, contributing to both FrontEnd and BackEnd topics. |
| Vladimir            | 4/5                     | Vladimir's contributions were consistent and effective, particularly in understanding password security and JWT in the BackEnd. |
| Augustas            | 4/5                     | Augustas played a key role in our group activities, contributing to both FrontEnd and BackEnd discussions. |

## Challenges Faced

***Week 5 introduced challenges as we delved into Fetch API, Forms, and BackEnd security aspects. Understanding the implementation of useEffect() and handling JWT required focused effort.***

## What Went Well and Lessons Learned

***During Week 5, our group successfully grasped Fetch API, Forms, useEffect(), and BackEnd security concepts. Group activities and discussions enhanced our understanding of both FrontEnd and BackEnd fundamentals.***

- #### Key Learning

***I gained a solid understanding of Fetch API, Forms, and the useEffect() hook in React. Learning about password security, JWT, and encryption provided insights into BackEnd security practices.***

- #### Application of Knowledge

***The practical application of Fetch API and Forms in FrontEnd development was a highlight. Hands-on experience with useEffect() and BackEnd security concepts allowed us to apply theoretical knowledge effectively.***

## Coping Strategies:

- #### Collaborative Problem-Solving:

***To address challenges, our group engaged in collaborative problem-solving. We actively discussed and clarified doubts, leveraging each member's strengths to overcome difficulties.***

- #### Practical Application:

***I focused on applying the knowledge learned through practical work on our project and hands-on activities in both FrontEnd and BackEnd development. This helped solidify my understanding of diverse concepts.***

## Project Management:

***During Week 5, we continued to apply agile principles to our development tasks. Group activities and discussions were structured, allowing for effective time management and understanding of complex concepts in both FrontEnd and BackEnd.***

## Final Thoughts:

***Week 5 has been dynamic, covering a broad spectrum of both FrontEnd and BackEnd development. The integration of Fetch API, Forms, and useEffect() in React, along with BackEnd security practices, has strengthened our overall understanding. I am excited about applying these concepts to our project and further exploring advanced features in the upcoming weeks.***

## Next Steps:

***In Week 6, I look forward to further deepening my knowledge of advanced React concepts and exploring more complex BackEnd security features. Our group will continue refining both FrontEnd and BackEnd components for our project, ensuring a seamless integration. I plan to further explore authentication and authorization mechanisms and enhance the overall security of our project as we progress through development.***
