# Reflection Journal for Week 7

**Student Name:** Mamadou Balde

**Week 7:** 04/12/23 - 10/12/23

## Peer Assessment

Week 7 marked a transition to FrontEnd development, focusing on topics like `useReducer()`, `useContext()`, and various aspects of Testing and Deployment. Here's an assessment of each group member's performance:

| Group Member's Name | Rate on a Scale of 1-5 | Justify My Answer |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Self (Balde)        | 4/5                     | Actively engaged in grasping FrontEnd concepts, particularly `useReducer()` and `useContext()`. Contributions were consistent in group discussions and testing activities. |
| Sami                | 4/5                     | Continued to be an active team member, adapting well to the transition to FrontEnd development. Demonstrated good understanding in practical activities related to testing and deployment. |
| Vladimir            | 4/5                     | Vladimir adapted quickly to FrontEnd topics, actively participating in discussions on `useReducer()` and `useContext()`. Showed proficiency in testing strategies. |
| Augustas            | 4/5                     | Augustas played a significant role in group activities, contributing to FrontEnd discussions and demonstrating competence in testing and deployment processes. |

## Challenges Faced

Week 7 presented challenges. Understanding the intricacies of `useReducer()` and `useContext()` required focused effort. Testing and deployment, while crucial, introduced a new layer of complexity.

## What Went Well and Lessons Learned

During Week 7, our group successfully delved into FrontEnd development, exploring `useReducer()` and `useContext()` alongside essential topics of Testing and Deployment. Practical activities enhanced our understanding of these FrontEnd fundamentals.

- **Key Learning**

I gained a solid understanding of `useReducer()` and `useContext()` in managing state on the FrontEnd. Exploring Testing and Deployment strategies provided insights into ensuring the robustness and reliability of our applications.

- **Application of Knowledge**

The practical application of `useReducer()` and `useContext()` in FrontEnd development, coupled with testing and deployment practices, allowed us to apply theoretical knowledge effectively.

## Coping Strategies:

- **Collaborative Problem-Solving:**

To address challenges, our group engaged in collaborative problem-solving. We actively discussed and clarified doubts, leveraging each member's strengths to overcome difficulties in FrontEnd development.

- **Thorough Testing:**

Understanding the importance of testing, we planned testing practices using tools like Newman, Superagent, and Supertest. This ensured the reliability and stability of our FrontEnd components.

## Project Management:

During Week 7, we continued applying agile principles to our development tasks, managing both BackEnd and FrontEnd components effectively. Group activities and discussions were structured, allowing for a seamless integration of the FrontEnd functionalities into our project.

## Final Thoughts:

Week 7 has been a challenging yet rewarding experience. The exploration of `useReducer()` and `useContext()`, coupled with Testing and Deployment, has broadened our skill set. I am excited about the prospect of combining BackEnd and FrontEnd knowledge to create a comprehensive and robust project.

## Next Steps:

In the upcoming weeks, I plan to further deepen my FrontEnd knowledge, exploring advanced features and refining our project. Collaboration with the team will remain a priority as we aim for a seamless integration of both BackEnd and FrontEnd components. I look forward to the continued evolution of our project and the challenges and learning opportunities it brings.
