# Reflection Journal for Week 3
**Student Name:** Mamadou Balde

**Week 3:** 06/11/23 - 12/11/23

## Peer Assessment

In Week 3, our focus shifted to the BackEnd aspects of web development, covering essential topics such as MVC pattern, routers and controllers, middleware, and HTTP status codes. Here's how each member of my group performed during this week:

| Group Member's Name | Rate on a Scale of 1-5 | Justify My Answer |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Self (Balde)        | 4/5                     | I actively engaged in understanding and applying BackEnd concepts. I contributed to group activities related to MVC pattern, routers and controllers, and middleware. |
| Sami                | 4/5                     | Sami continued to be a valuable team member, actively participating in discussions and group activities focused on the BackEnd. |
| Vladimir            | 4/5                     | Vladimir's contributions were consistent, especially in grasping the MVC pattern and effectively utilizing routers and controllers. |
| Augustas            | 4/5                     | Augustas played a key role in our group activities, particularly in understanding middleware and its application in the BackEnd. |

## Challenges Faced

***Week 3 introduced challenges as we delved into the BackEnd development. Understanding the intricacies of the MVC pattern and effectively implementing routers and controllers presented some difficulties. Additionally, comprehending the nuances of middleware and error middleware required focused effort.***

## What Went Well and Lessons Learned

***During Week 3, our group successfully grasped the MVC pattern, routers, controllers, and middleware concepts. Group activities and discussions enhanced our understanding of these BackEnd fundamentals. We successfully distinguished between application-level and route-based middleware and explored error middleware. HTTP status codes were effectively covered.***

- #### Key Learning

***I gained a solid understanding of BackEnd architecture and how MVC pattern, routers, and controllers play a crucial role in structuring applications. Learning about middleware and its various types, especially error middleware, provided insights into enhancing application robustness.***

- #### Application of Knowledge

***The application of Express.js for implementing routers and controllers was a practical highlight. Hands-on experience in distinguishing between application-level and route-based middleware proved beneficial. Understanding HTTP status codes will undoubtedly contribute to effective error handling in future projects.***

## Coping Strategies:

- #### Collaborative Problem-Solving:

***To address challenges, our group engaged in collaborative problem-solving. We actively discussed and clarified doubts, leveraging each member's strengths to overcome difficulties.***

- #### Practical Application:

***I focused on applying theoretical knowledge through practical exercises and hands-on activities. This helped solidify my understanding of BackEnd concepts.***

## Project Management:

***During Week 3, we applied agile principles to our BackEnd development tasks. Group activities and discussions were structured, allowing for effective time management and understanding of complex concepts.***

## Final Thoughts:

***Week 3 has been pivotal in expanding our understanding of BackEnd development. The intricacies of MVC pattern, routers, controllers, and middleware have been demystified, setting a strong foundation for future development work. I look forward to applying these concepts to our project and continuing the journey into advanced BackEnd development.***

## Next Steps:

***In Week 4, I am eager to delve deeper into Express.js, focusing on advanced features such as error handling and security. Our group will continue refining our BackEnd architecture, ensuring the seamless integration of BackEnd and FrontEnd components. I plan to further explore middleware and its application in real-world scenarios. Our aim is to enhance the robustness and efficiency of our project as we progress through the development phases.***
