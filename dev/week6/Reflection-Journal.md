|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Self (Balde)        | 4/5                     | Actively engaged in understanding localStorage, custom hooks, and React JWT authentication. Contributions were consistent in group discussions and activities. |
| Sami                | 4/5                     | Continued to be an active team member, contributing effectively to discussions on localStorage and custom hooks. Demonstrated good understanding in practical activities. |
| Vladimir            | 4/5                     | Vladimir's contributions were consistent and valuable, particularly in grasping React JWT authentication and custom hooks. Showed good understanding in application scenarios. |
| Augustas            | 4/5                     | Augustas played a significant role in group activities, contributing to discussions on localStorage and demonstrating proficiency in custom hooks. |

## Challenges Faced

Week 6 presented challenges as we delved into localStorage intricacies and React JWT authentication. Understanding the nuances of custom hooks and their optimal usage required focused effort.

## What Went Well and Lessons Learned

During Week 6, our group successfully grasped localStorage concepts, custom hooks, and React JWT authentication. Practical activities enhanced our understanding of these FrontEnd fundamentals.

- **Key Learning**

I gained a solid understanding of localStorage, custom hooks, and React JWT authentication. Learning to implement JWT authentication in a React application was particularly insightful.

- **Application of Knowledge**

The practical application of localStorage and custom hooks in FrontEnd development, along with the implementation of React JWT authentication, allowed us to apply theoretical knowledge effectively.

## Coping Strategies:

- **Collaborative Problem-Solving:**

To address challenges, our group engaged in collaborative problem-solving. We actively discussed and clarified doubts, leveraging each member's strengths to overcome difficulties.

- **Practical Application:**

I focused on applying the knowledge learned through practical work on our project and hands-on activities in both localStorage and React JWT authentication. This helped solidify my understanding of these diverse concepts.

## Project Management:

During Week 6, we continued to apply agile principles to our development tasks. Group activities and discussions were structured, allowing for effective time management and understanding of complex concepts in both FrontEnd and BackEnd.

## Final Thoughts:

Week 6 has been dynamic, covering a broad spectrum of FrontEnd development. The integration of localStorage, custom hooks, and React JWT authentication has strengthened our overall understanding. I am excited about applying these concepts to our project and further exploring advanced features in the upcoming weeks.

## Next Steps:

In Week 7, I look forward to further deepening my knowledge of advanced React concepts and exploring more complex FrontEnd development features. Our group will continue refining both FrontEnd and BackEnd components for our project, ensuring a seamless integration. I plan to further explore advanced techniques in localStorage and enhance the overall functionality of our project as we progress through development.
