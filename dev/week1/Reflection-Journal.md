## Challenges Faced

***This week brought some challenges. We had to find a project idea that suited our group, and it took time to reach a consensus. Additionally, we faced some time management issues as we tried to balance our coursework with the project.***

## What Went Well and Lessons Learned

***Our group discussions and brainstorming sessions went well, and I learned the importance of effective collaboration. I also gained a better understanding of the concept of agile project management. I went through various online resources, such as Scrimba tutorials, articles, videos, and documentation, valuable for learning and problem-solving.***

- #### Key Learning

***I learned about the agile project management principles and how they can influence my approach to project work and collaboration. The concept of building a full-stack application using technologies like MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and React was also a significant learning point. I started gained a better understanding of the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and how these technologies interact.***

- #### Online Resources

***I found those various online resources you provided very useful, including [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), [Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrTQipWp6co) and [GitHub tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibmWyt8hfw), [Node.js Tutorial for Beginners: (First 40min only)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlB_eWDSMt4), [NPM Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHDhaSSKmB0), [Introduction to Scrum - 7 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TycLR0TqFA) and [Scrum in 20 mins - with Figma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWDhGSZNF9M) files. Today I stated going through this: [React Tutorial for Beginners (till 20min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk).***

## Coping Strategies:

- #### Academic Progress:

***To overcome the challenges I faced, I made sure to communicate effectively within the group, manage my time efficiently and seeking help from online resources. The team scheduled regular meetings to discuss progress and challenges.***

- #### Soft Skills Development

***My soft skills, such as communication and collaboration, played a crucial role in the successful project planning and discussions.***

## Project Management:

***The principles of agile project management influenced my approach to the project. I understood the importance of regular meetings and adapting to changes in requirements.***

## Final Thoughts:

***Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the Web development and Web Project courses. I have set a solid foundation for my upcoming project and have gained valuable insights into effective collaboration and project management.***

## Next Steps:

*In the upcoming week, I aim to continue our project discussions on Monday and finalize the project idea. I will dive deeper into learning the technologies required for the project, particularly focusing on MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and React. I look forward to applying agile principles effectively in our project's development process.*
