# Reflection Journal for Week 4
**Student Name:** Mamadou Balde

**Week 4:** 13/11/23 - 19/11/23

## Peer Assessment

In Week 4, our focus expanded to both BackEnd and FrontEnd topics. The BackEnd covered SQL to MongoDB mapping, JavaScript async/await, Mongoose, CRUD operations, and Express.js. The FrontEnd touched on array destructuring, React events, state management with the useState hook, component lifecycle, and React Router. Here's how each member of my group performed during this week:

| Group Member's Name | Rate on a Scale of 1-5 | Justify My Answer |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Self (Balde)        | 4/5                     | I actively engaged in understanding and applying both BackEnd and FrontEnd concepts. My contributions were consistent in group discussions and activities. |
| Sami                | 4/5                     | Sami continued to be a valuable team member, actively participating in both BackEnd and FrontEnd topics. |
| Vladimir            | 4/5                     | Vladimir's contributions were consistent and effective, particularly in understanding and applying Mongoose and CRUD operations. |
| Augustas            | 4/5                     | Augustas played a key role in our group activities, contributing to both BackEnd and FrontEnd discussions. |

## Challenges Faced

***Week 4 introduced challenges as we delved into both BackEnd and FrontEnd aspects. Understanding the SQL to MongoDB mapping, Mongoose, and React events required focused effort. Additionally, managing state with the useState hook presented some difficulties.***

## What Went Well and Lessons Learned

***During Week 4, our group successfully grasped SQL to MongoDB mapping, Mongoose, CRUD operations, and React concepts. Group activities and discussions enhanced our understanding of both BackEnd and FrontEnd fundamentals.***

- #### Key Learning

***I gained a solid understanding of Mongoose and how to perform CRUD operations using Express.js. Learning about React events and state management with the useState hook provided insights into building interactive user interfaces.***

- #### Application of Knowledge

***The practical application of Mongoose in BackEnd development was a highlight. Hands-on experience with CRUD operations and React concepts allowed us to apply theoretical knowledge effectively.***

## Coping Strategies:

- #### Collaborative Problem-Solving:

***To address challenges, our group engaged in collaborative problem-solving. We actively discussed and clarified doubts, leveraging each member's strengths to overcome difficulties.***

- #### Practical Application:

***I focused on applying the knowledge learned through practical on our project and hands-on activities in both BackEnd and FrontEnd development. This helped solidify my understanding of diverse concepts.***

## Project Management:

***During Week 4, we continued to apply agile principles to our development tasks. Group activities and discussions were structured, allowing for effective time management and understanding of complex concepts in both BackEnd and FrontEnd.***

## Final Thoughts:

***Week 4 has been dynamic, covering a broad spectrum of both BackEnd and FrontEnd development. The integration of SQL to MongoDB mapping, Mongoose, and React concepts has strengthened our overall understanding. I am excited about applying these concepts to our project and further exploring advanced features in the upcoming weeks.***

## Next Steps:

***In Week 5, I look forward to deepening my knowledge of role-based access in Express.js and exploring more advanced React concepts. Our group will continue refining both BackEnd and FrontEnd components for our project, ensuring a seamless integration. I plan to further explore state management in React and enhance the user experience of our project as we progress through development.***
